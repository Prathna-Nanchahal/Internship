------------------
## Task 1 was to do Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 
I have taken a Vehicle Sales Data having different columns like 
> ORDERNUMBER, QUANTITYORDERED, PRICEEACH,	ORDERLINENUMBER,	ORDERDATE,	STATUS,	QTR, MONTH, YEAR,	PRODUCTLINE,	PRODUCTCODE,	CUSTOMERNAME,	ADDRESSLINE1&2.........

Well it might look that the data is simple but have lots of issues like nulls,duplicate, date formats, segregated data, extra & repeated info.

As we all know that a raw data is of no use till the time it's been correctly cleaned & processed.
So, now i'm going to clean the data by following steps :-
1) Removing Duplicates
2) Treating Nulls
3) Removing unnecessary/repeated info (like 'QTR', 'ADDRESS')
4) Concatenating/Merging columns (like 'Contact name') 

After performing all the requireded steps 
Now, the data is ready to be used for analysis.ðŸ“Š
